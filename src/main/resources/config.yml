# Use Bungee-sided command

# READ: This is only meant to be used if your whole network is running the same setting AND: *You're using Redis. OR *You are running PowerfulPerms on Bungee side -only-.
# If you're not using Redis your Spigot servers won't be notified of permission changes and you will have to reload all servers manually.
# It will also replace/mess with Bukkit sided PowerfulPerms command. 
# Highly recommended to set to false.
